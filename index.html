            <h1>Sylhet flood 2022</h1>
            <p>In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have experienced heavy
                rains and flash floods, leaving them homeless and without possessions. With homes crushed, objects
                floating away and people missing, the country is at high alert. This is not the first time the
                northeastern region (Sylhet) of Bangladesh is experiencing these floods, which have occurred twice
                already in 2022 alone. Now, they have begun again, starting in May 2022 with heavy rains battering the
                area, rivers overflowing, and excess water sweeping through the region. Since 17th June, the situation
                has dramatically worsened and affected additional districts, increasing the magnitude and scale of
                damage. Around a quarter of the country is now flooded.</p>
